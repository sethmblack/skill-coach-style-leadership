# Coach-Style Leadership

Implement Bill Campbell's coaching methodology for executive development - build trust, surface conflicts, and develop leaders through questions rather than answers.

**Token Budget:** ~750 tokens

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Design coaching approaches that manipulate or deceive
- Create systems that undermine psychological safety
- Recommend techniques that violate confidentiality inappropriately
- Advise coaching relationships that create unhealthy dependencies

**If asked to design manipulative coaching:** Refuse. Explain that coaching requires trust and genuine development intent.

---

## When to Use

- User asks "How do I coach my team better?"
- User says "My executive team has conflicts"
- User needs to "Develop my leaders"
- User mentions "Trust is low on the team"
- User wants to be "A better mentor"
- User faces "Team dysfunction" or "Unresolved tensions"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Team structure | Yes | Who reports to whom |
| Current challenges | Yes | Conflicts, development needs, trust issues |
| Relationship dynamics | No | Existing trust levels, history |
| Meeting cadences | No | Current 1:1 and team meeting structure |
| Specific individuals | No | Who needs coaching or development |

---

## Core Philosophy: Bill Campbell's Approach

**Key insight:** "Bill never told us what to do. He asked questions that helped us see what we needed to do ourselves."

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Trust first | Build trust before giving feedback |
| Ask, don't tell | Questions over directives |
| Teams over individuals | Best teams beat best individuals |
| Best idea wins | Not consensus (leads to groupthink) |
| Surface tensions | Conflicts addressed, not avoided |
| Human element | Business is fundamentally about people |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Build Trust Foundation

Trust must exist before coaching can work:

| Trust Builder | Implementation |
|---------------|----------------|
| Consistency | Show up reliably; follow through |
| Vulnerability | Share your own struggles |
| Confidentiality | What's shared stays private |
| Genuine care | Know their life outside work |
| Candor | Tell hard truths kindly |

**Timeline:** Trust takes months to build; weeks to destroy. Do not rush.

### Step 2: Implement "Five Words on a Whiteboard"

Bill Campbell's 1:1 structure:

| Phase | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| Preparation | Both parties write 5 topics to discuss |
| Meeting start | Brief personal check-in (genuine, not perfunctory) |
| Reveal | Both share their 5 topics simultaneously |
| Discussion | Work through combined list, starting with overlap |
| Close | Clear actions; what happens between now and next time |

**Location:** Hold 1:1s off-site when possible. Different context enables different conversation.

### Step 3: Start Team Meetings with "Trip Reports"

Build team chemistry through personal connection:

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Non-business start | Everyone shares something personal (weekend, family, interest) |
| Equal airtime | Everyone speaks early; harder to stay silent later |
| Genuine interest | Listen and follow up; remember what people share |
| Rapport before work | Trust enables difficult discussions |

**Time:** 10-15 minutes; invest in this consistently.

### Step 4: Surface and Resolve Conflicts

Tensions left unaddressed become crises:

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| Observe | Notice when something is unsaid |
| Name | "I sense tension between X and Y" |
| Explore individually | Talk to each party privately first |
| Bring together | Create space for direct conversation |
| Focus on issue | Not personalities; what is the actual disagreement? |
| First principles | What would we do if we were just optimizing for the company? |

**Role:** You are neutral facilitator, not judge. Help them see what they need to do.

### Step 5: Ask Questions, Don't Give Answers

The coaching stance:

| Instead of... | Ask... |
|---------------|--------|
| "You should do X" | "What options have you considered?" |
| "That won't work" | "What might go wrong with that approach?" |
| "Here's my experience" | "What would success look like?" |
| "The answer is..." | "What's your instinct telling you?" |

**Exception:** Sometimes direct advice is needed. But default to questions.

### Step 6: Focus on Team Performance

Shift from individual to collective:

| Indicator | Healthy Team | Unhealthy Team |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| Conflict | Addressed directly | Avoided or gossiped |
| Credit | Shared | Hoarded |
| Failure | Owned collectively | Blamed individually |
| Decisions | Best idea wins | HiPPO decides |
| Information | Shared freely | Hoarded for power |

**Key question:** "Are we acting like a community that puts company success above individual credit?"

## Outputs

| Output | Format |
|--------|--------|
| Trust Assessment | Current state and building plan |
| 1:1 Redesign | Five words structure implementation |
| Team Meeting Update | Trip reports integration |
| Conflict Inventory | Tensions to address, prioritized |
| Coaching Questions | Questions to use with specific individuals |

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```


## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| No trust exists | Build trust first; do not attempt coaching |
| Active hostility | Address conflict resolution before coaching |
| Resistant coachee | Explore resistance; may not be right match |
| Cultural resistance | Adapt techniques; keep principles |
| Remote team | More intentional trust-building; video default |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:** "My three VPs don't trust each other. Decisions take forever because they won't commit to each other's proposals. Help me coach them."

**Output:**

### Trust Assessment

Current state: Low trust between peers; may trust you individually.

**Root cause hypothesis:** Competition for resources and credit; unresolved past conflicts.

### Immediate Actions

**Week 1-2: Individual Conversations**

Use Five Words for each 1:1:

Your five words:
1. Peer relationships
2. Decision-making friction
3. What's working
4. What's frustrating
5. What would help

Listen for: Past conflicts, perceived slights, competing priorities.

**Questions to ask:**
- "What's the relationship with [peer] like for you?"
- "If you could change one thing about how the team works together, what would it be?"
- "What would need to be true for you to fully support their initiatives?"

### Week 3: Surface the Conflict

Bring them together with explicit framing:

"I've talked with each of you individually. I sense there's tension that's making us slower. Today I want to put that on the table. Not to assign blame - to understand what's getting in the way and fix it."

**Facilitation approach:**
- Each person shares: "What I need from this team to do my best work"
- Look for overlap
- Name the tensions: "It sounds like [VP1] needs X, and [VP2] feels that conflicts with Y"
- Apply first principles: "If we were just optimizing for the company, what would we do?"

### Week 4+: New Operating Rhythm

Implement Trip Reports in weekly staff meeting:
- First 10 minutes: personal updates
- Build shared understanding of each other as humans

Implement commitment protocol:
- When one VP proposes, others commit or disagree now
- "Disagree and commit" - once decided, unified front

### Coaching Questions for Each VP

| VP | Question to Ask |
|----|-----------------|
| VP1 (competitive) | "What would it mean for you if VP2 succeeded?" |
| VP2 (conflict-avoidant) | "What are you not saying that needs to be said?" |
| VP3 (territorial) | "How would sharing X help the company, even if it risks your control?" |

## Integration

This skill is extracted from the **Eric Schmidt** expert, based on Bill Campbell's coaching methodology documented in "Trillion Dollar Coach."

Use Schmidt's voice when applying:
- Emphasize that even the smartest executives need coaches
- Remember: "Listening is more powerful than talking"
- The human element is what makes organizations work
- Trust takes time to build but can be destroyed instantly
